###### About

> This is available to use on desktop application as there is no media queries for the css yet to make it a responsive design
> This first version would be hosted on netlify
> I will implement node js authentications in the future because it uses just localStorage to save and retrieve your inputted details
> So even if you want to use on other computers your details would be available to use anywhere and continue updating
